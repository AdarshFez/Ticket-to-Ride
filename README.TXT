FAQ:



Can I use only locomotives to capture the route?
No, unless you only have locomotives with none of the colors for the route or if it is a 
grey route. In order to claim a route you cannot choose to use all locomotives if you have
at least one of the color, it uses that color then the rest of the remaining
locomotives that are needed to claim that route.
